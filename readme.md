### 🛄 Description

In this project we're runing a Dices Game where you can roll with TWO dices and you win if the result equals 7.

It works with a mongoDB database where you can create a USER with a username and password in the body of POST request to the endpoint /player. 

The database also saves the rounds played for each player/user and calculates a winrate overall the results of the player list.

This GitHub Actions workflow automatically builds and tests the application when code changes are pushed to the master branch or a pull request targeting the master branch is opened or synchronized.


### 🎲 Endpoints
   ``` POST /login ```: checks if the user is in the database and returns a JWT token.
   
   ``` POST /player```: adds a new player to the database with an id and a password.
   
   ``` GET /players ```: returns all the players in the database with their winrate.
   
   ``` PUT /player/:id```: change the name of the user where the body has to have a "newId" : "newUserName".
   
   ``` POST /games/:id```: play a round with the user setted in the endpoint :id.
   
   ``` GET /games/:id```: show all the rounds played by the user at the endpoint :id.
   
   ``` DELETE /games/:id```: delete all the rounds from a user :id.
   
   ``` GET /ranking```: display all the players sorted by winrate of the player.
   
   ``` GET /ranking/winner```: shows the player with highest winrate.
   
   ``` GET /ranking/loser```: show the player with the lowest winrate.
   
     



### 📥 Installation

To get started with this template, you first need to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AraManjon/typescript-tdd-template.git
```

Then, install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 🏁 How To Start

To start the server in development mode, run the following script:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Then, open http://localhost:8000 to access the server.


### 🚀 Production

To run the server in production mode, first build the TypeScript code into JavaScript by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the dist directory with the compiled JavaScript files.

Then, start the server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the server and make it available at http://localhost:8000.


### 🏗️ Scripts
This project comes with several predefined scripts in the package.json file:

```test```: Runs tests using Jest.

```lint```: Runs ESLint to check code quality.

```lint:fix```: Runs ESLint to fix code style issues.

```dev```: Starts the development server with ts-node-dev and allows debugging

```build```: Removes the ./dist folder and compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript in the ./dist folder.

```start```: Starts the server in production using the compiled files in the dist/ folder.
